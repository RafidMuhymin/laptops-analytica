## What I have done in four steps

- I have used the `create-react-app` starter to bootstrap a `react` project.
- I have used the `react-router-dom` library for the routing of the application.
- I have used the `recharts` library for the charts used in the project.
- I have used the `Iconify` (`@iconify/react`) library for the icons used in the project.
